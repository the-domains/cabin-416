description: We started Porch Light to re-create that feeling you get when coming home - those warm fuzzy feelings after being away for a long time... We are two hopeless romantics who found each other in a time where our faith in love was tested and our search for true romance seemed eternal...

<article style=""><h1>Soap - Simple + Soft</h1><p>A vegan soap with no added scents to refresh and replenish.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e9e25661febe11b0f71605482940ab7aabee6eee.jpg" /></article>

This is a vegan and unscented bar (meaning we didn't add anything extra to scent it!). A rich lather leaves your skin refreshed and restored and ready for the day ahead. This bar is especially great for sensitive skin.

**Benefits: **coconut and olive oil to moisturize and condition, castor oil to protect against the elements and boost your immune system, and a touch of sweet almond oil which is rich in vitamins A, B, and E and great for skin health. This soap is happily Vegan!

We make all of our soaps by hand in small batches using all-natural ingredients. Because of this, individual bars may differ slightly from photo.

For best results get wet, turn off the water, take your time lathering up, rinse.
