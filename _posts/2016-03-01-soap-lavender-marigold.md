Our Lavender + Marigold soap is the perfect scent to soothe and calm your senses. The subtle smell of lavender and soft marigold petals in this bar creates a soft exfoliation and rich lather leaving your skin velvety and refreshed.

**Benefits:**coconut and olive oil to moisturize and condition, castor oil to protect against the elements and boost your immune system, lavender to relax your senses and promote healthy digestion, and marigold petals for a light, healing exfoliation. This soap is also Vegan!

We make all of our soaps by hand in small batches using all-natural ingredients. Because of this, individual bars may differ slightly from photo.

For best results get wet, turn off the water, take your time lathering up, rinse.
